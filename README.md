packagemonkey 
=============

<b>A tool to make packaging easier</b>

Description
-----------

Creating installable packages for Linux ditros has always been a bit of a black art.  There is a lot of documentation out there and it's often voluminous and not especially easy to interpret.  When doing packaging by hand there are also many ways to go wrong.

Packagemonkey is intended to make packaging simpler, and enable the creation of multiple different types of package.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is from a pre-compiled package, a number of which are available at:

    https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Amotters%3Apackagemonkey

But if you prefer not to get involved with binaries then this program is pretty easy to compile and install as follows.

Check out the latest source code:

    git clone https://github.com/fuzzgun/packagemonkey.git

Then to build and install:

    cd packagemonkey
    make
    sudo make install

If you wish to generate a Debian package you can also run the following script:

    ./debian.sh

or an RPM can be generated by running:

    ./rpm.sh
